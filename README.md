# Task

The task was to predict future sales based on its previous sales . So the base model was created by applying normal linear regression , after this it became clear that it is non - linear in nature , the other algorithm applied was XGboost , XGboost is way better in treating non-linear nature than normal regression . So Xgboost was used as the final algorithm to calculate the result .

Other things that can also be done :
1)Dimensionality Reduction by PCA or Isomap .
2)Applying non-linear regression or Robust-Regression .
